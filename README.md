# Etch-a-Sketch
This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum.
## Project Reflections

This project really helped to solidify my understanding of DOM manipulation; though there is still much to learn, I feel much more comfortable navigating the DOM and getting things to look and behave how I want it to. Overall I think this project was good practice for my html/css/javascript skills and especially useful in recognizing that I can break things up into seperate functions to improve readability.

I have plans to revisit this project in the future and make it a pixel art sketch app.
